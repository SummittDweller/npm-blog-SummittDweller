  <h2>I Like to Walk</h2><br/>

  <p>My home in Toledo is near the geographic center of the Tama-Toledo "metropolitan" area.  From my door I can walk 30 minutes, about 1.5 miles, in any direction and reach everything within the cities' limits.  When I have somewhere to go in-town, I'll walk there and back if the weather is good, the route is clear, and if I have sufficient time to do so.  I also like to ride my bike (I have two of them now) so sometimes I'll do that in a pinch. If you see me driving or riding in a car around town it's a safe-bet that I'm transporting something too bulky to carry, or I didn't have time to walk or bike. Also, there's this... <a href="https://blog.summittdweller.com/posts/trash-walks/">Pandemic Pastime: Walking and Picking Up Trash</a>.</p>

  <p>What follows is a chronicle of walks and bike rides, grouped by month, that I've taken and recorded over the last couple of years. I don't always remember to toggle the "workout" app on my Apple Watch, but I'm getting better at remembering that too. Maybe posting these tracks here will give me renewed purpose, and I'll do an even better job of tracking myself?  Let's hope so.</p>
  
  <h3>Highlighted, Memorable Routes</h3>
  <p>Some of my routes, not all of them on foot or bike, are <b>highlighted</b> because they were memorable. Links to these routes are listed in their own "Highlighted Routes" section below. In their individual posts I've tried to include a brief description of the route/event, and some include links to additional details. 
    
  <h3>Green Routes</h3>
  <p>In March 2021 I also started recording the approximate amount of <span style='color:green; font-weight:bold;'>trash</span> collected by me and my scurry partners. I call these <span style='color:green; font-weight:bold;'>Green</span> routes and they are listed with a <span style='color:green; font-weight:bold;'>[Green]</span> annotation in the list below.  Each <span style='color:green; font-weight:bold;'>Green</span> route also includes a <i>Trash Statistics</i> summary at the bottom of its individual page.</p>
