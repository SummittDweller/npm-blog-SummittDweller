This is just a page where Mackenzie and me test our newest features in [Hugo](https://hugo.io).  The features you see as examples below include:

  - A dynamic simple markdown (.md) file pulled from _Dropbox_  at run-time and presented with a red border,
  - A static **announcement** showing the contents of `/contents/announcement.md` with a yellow border,
  - A dynamic list of my latest 10 public gists (I have fewer than 10 at present) presented in a black border, and 
  - Another dynamic element, my latest **unexpired** _Tweet_ in a light blue border with an accompanying explanation below it.
  
Note that if you don't see the last of these features, the _Tweet_, it's probably because I haven't Tweeted anything in more than a week. ‚è≥ I'll try to do better in the future.
