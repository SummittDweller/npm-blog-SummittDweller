I find myself at a crossroads.  Those of you who know me well are probably aware that I have never been a fan, advocate, or avid user of _Facebook_, or social media in general.  

I do like FB _Marketplace_ though.  I've had some wonderful experiences buying or selling things there.  Sure, there have been some unpleasant _Marketplace_ experiences, too, but the good far outweighs the bad, so I will probably stick with it.    

The same goes for FB _Messenger_.  I prefer using email or text messaging for online communication, but for my _Marketplace_ communications, and especially for staying in touch with all my distant friends, _Messenger_ is a must.  Not all the time, but often enough that I will probably stick with using _Messenger_, too.    

Research tells me that I can't leave _Facebook_ without also losing _Marketplace_ and _Messenger_.  Well, crap.  

That research also shows me that lots of other people would like to do the same, disengage from social media, but keep the positive and useful things in play.  This is not a paid endorsement, but my research did also lead me to an app called _SocialFocus_.  If you are interested, please check it out: [https://socialfocus.app/](https://socialfocus.app/).  

I'll try not to get long-winded here, but I wanted to share one other thing from my research...  

This morning as I was browsing in _Marketplace_, something popped into my _Facebook_ feed and I opened it, perhaps for the last time.  I came across a photo (https://www.tamatoledonews.com/news/local-news/2025/09/19/stc-announces-2025-homecoming-court/) posted by _TamaToledoNews_.  I don't know most of the kids at STC any more, so it wasn't the group of smiling young faces that caught my attention, although I wish them all the best.  It was the _**setting of this photo**_ that brought a tear to my eye.  If I am given permission, I will add a copy of the image in this blog because you never know how long _Facebook_ will last, and you certainly never know who might not be able to open _Facebook_ now, or in the future.  I know I won't.  

I can't verify this, _because that would almost certainly require more interaction with FB_, but I believe that the photo was taken beneath a willow tree planted on October 8, 2012, the day my son was buried, by members of the Iowa Geocachers Organization board of directors, and friends.  One of those folks, Liz, became a good friend and the tears I shed this morning are for Ian, and for Liz as she celebrates her first heavenly birthday.  

It's postings from Liz, and many others like her, that I will miss the most.  

When Ian passed I was moved by the outpouring of love and support we received.  I still am to this day.  But, I was also moved in a very different manner by all the hateful speculation and vitriol that I found online.  In spite of the positives, I choose to pull back from social media in 2012, and was glad that I had when the 2016 election cycle rolled around.  In years since I've gradually drifted back into social media, largely driven by connections with young people and distant friends who had no other simple means of keeping in touch.  

But the vitriol is back, so I'm done.    

In the absence of social media I've no doubt that I will find comfort in actual things, like Ian's tree(s), and the good people in my life who occasionally visit in-person, or know me well enough to share an update via text message, email, or a phone call (yes, Mary reminds me that you can still do that with your phone) at times.  If I sent you a link to this post, via whatever means available, then you'll know you are one of the people I will miss and I hope you will find a way to keep in touch.
