Today I'm rebranding the Tama-Toledo Community Visioning (CV) site to Hometown Action Team (HAT) and adding Pagefind.

When doing so I get this build error...  

{{% original %}}
Warning: Running in pre-1.0 compatibility mode.
Pagefind 1.0 changes the default output directory from /_pagefind/ to /pagefind/
but references to the /_pagefind/ URL were found on your site, and the output directory is unconfigured.
To preserve your setup, the search files have been written twice, to both /_pagefind/ and /pagefind/

To remove this warning, either update your script and style references to the new `/pagefind/` URL
or run Pagefind with `--output-subdir _pagefind` to ensure pre-1.0 behaviour
{{% /original %}}

So, I am going to try changing all _pagefind references to just 'pagefind'.  Wish me luck
