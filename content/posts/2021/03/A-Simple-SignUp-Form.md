For 2021 I've signed on to be a member of the steering committee for Toledo's 2021 [Community Visioning (CV)](https://www.communityvisioning.org/toledo/) project coordinated by [Tree's Forever and Iowa's Living Roadways](http://www.treesforever.org/IowasLivingRoadways), [Iowa State University Extension and Outreach](https://www.extension.iastate.edu/), and other partners.  Tama is also a [Community Visioning](https://www.communityvisioning.org/tama/) participant in 2021.
