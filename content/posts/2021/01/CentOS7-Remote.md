This past weekend I managed to get a *VNC* server running on my **centos7** node, where I run *Paperless*.  The build instructions came from [https://www.howtoforge.com/vnc-server-installation-on-centos-7](https://www.howtoforge.com/vnc-server-installation-on-centos-7). The node is available at `192.168.1.22:5901`.
