Just completed download, config, build and install of [Merlin 2.1.x firmware](https://marlinfw.org/meta/download/) for my Creality Ender 3 Pro with a v4.2.7 Motherboard and TMC2225 Driver (for Marlin 2.0.1).  I followed this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZdI1jRGVv4) for install guidance, then did a bed leveling procedure.  

However, at this point Octoprint is throwing an error stating that...

```
Your printer's firmware supports host action commands, but they are disabled. The firmware will not inform OctoPrint about job pause & cancellations, filament runouts, and similar firmware-side events. If you want this functionality, you need to change your firmware's configuration.
```

So, when I get home next week it looks like this will need more attention.
