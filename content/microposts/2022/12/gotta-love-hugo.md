Ya' gotta love [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)! I just completed my first _Jekyll_-to-_Hugo_ conversion, and made it a [Hugo module](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/).  It's taken me a couple of years to realize the power of Hugo modules, and I have to say it's _AWESOME_, and perfectly implemented.

The process of conversion briefly is documented in the `README.md` file at [SummittDweller/hugo-timeline](https://github.com/SummittDweller/hugo-timeline), and the first use of it as a module appears elsewhere in this blog at [My Hugo Timeline, A New Hugo Module](/content/posts/12/my-hugo-timeline).  The timeline itself can be seen at https://blog.SummittDweller.com/timeline.   Check it out!
