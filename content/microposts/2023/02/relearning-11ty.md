As I started to follow-up on [Gating My Content & More - Parts 1 and 2](https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/139-gating-my-content-and-more/) I quickly realized that I've already forgotten most of what I learned about [eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) back in December.  So, since I already have years of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) experience, I elected to "begin again" with [Migrating from Hugo to Eleventy](https://ttntm.me/blog/migrating-from-hugo-to-eleventy/) and that article makes an early reference to [A Deep Dive Into Eleventy Static Site Generator](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/03/eleventy-static-site-generator/).  If those fail there's [Let's Learn Eleventy](https://dev.to/psypher1/lets-learn-eleventy-1a67).  

In case it's needed later, I captured all of the sites listed above in a [OneTab page](https://www.one-tab.com/page/6DzScWRTSkaO5xr7YGC2Hg).
