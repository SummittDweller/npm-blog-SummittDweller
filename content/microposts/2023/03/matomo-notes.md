Last weekend Mackenzie and I created a new [Matomo](https://matomo.org/) analytics server on a _DigitalOcean_ droplet w/ 2G of RAM.  The story of its development and maintenance is being told in [Matomo Installation Notes](https://github.com/SummittDweller/how-MY-web-works/blob/main/docs/07-Matomo.md) and its dashboard is available at https://analytics.summittservices.com.
