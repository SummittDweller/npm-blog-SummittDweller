Last weekend Mackenzie and I created a new [Matomo](https://matomo.org/) analytics server on a _DigitalOcean_ droplet w/ 2G of RAM.  This weekend we created a new headless [Ghost CMS](https://ghost.org) droplet to support her portfolio site, and more.  This evening I'm taking steps to begin rewriting this blog as a Ghost + 11ty reincarnation of what you see here now.  The story of the underlying Ghost development and maintenance is told in [Ghost Notes](https://github.com/SummittDweller/how-MY-web-works/blob/main/docs/09-Ghost.md) and its admin dashboard is available at https://ghost.summittservices.com/ghost.
