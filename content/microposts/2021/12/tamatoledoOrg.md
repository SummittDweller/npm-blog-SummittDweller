Yes, it has been far too long since I posted here.  Sorry.

In the past week me and Mackenzie have taken steps to start revamping _TamaToledo.org_, all using _GitHub Pages_ to host sites.  Thus far we have a new landing page at https://TamaToledo.org, a re-publish of https://STC-REC.TamaToledo.org, and a new `Tama-Toledo Community Visioning` site at https://cv.TamaToledo.org.  Check them out!
