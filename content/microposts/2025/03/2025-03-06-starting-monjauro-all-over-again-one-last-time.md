So, back in December my health insurance provider denied my refill prescription for Monjauro injections.  I missed a week of injections after 3 months without a miss.  My doctor appealed the decision... couple weeks later "DENIED".  They appealed again... two more weeks "DENIED".  Then the very next day I get a message essentially saying "Oops, you're approved".   So almost 7 weeks later I now get to start again from square one.    

This is my FOURTH time on such a regimen, the first 3 were all terminated by insurance or supply problems.   

If this round gets terminated I will be terminating something in return.
