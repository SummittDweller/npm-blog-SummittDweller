IMHO, medical care in the United States is AMAZING.  A family member had outpatient surgery to implant two stents in their chest this morning, is on their way home now, and cleared to fly away on vacation this Friday.  My daughter's stroke treatment, therapy and recovery was equally AMAZING (and frankly, fascinating).  

But I find medical administration (presumably due to insurance requirements?) in this country to be ABYSMAL.  I suspect most medical staff are overworked, but with treatment provided by 4 or more organizations I find they can pass the buck faster than the government, and simply do not communicate well.      

Case in point... MercyCare uses "My Chart" software and I love it.  UIHC also uses "My Chart", but the two are entirely different things (same software, different "systems") and don't share any information.   Chaos rules.
