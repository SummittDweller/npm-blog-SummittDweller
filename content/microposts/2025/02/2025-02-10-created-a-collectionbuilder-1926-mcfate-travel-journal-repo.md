This evening I created the [1926 McFate Travel Journal](https://github.com/SummittDweller/1926-mcfate-travel-journal) repo from the [grinnell-college-CB-base](https://github.com/Digital-Grinnell/grinnell-college-base-CB) template repo.  Now I need a script that will break the primary .md document into smaller chunks, and update them in Azure Blob storage.
