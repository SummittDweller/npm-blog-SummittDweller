It's long overdue but this evening I managed to re-spin my `the-Helge-Project` genealogy website by adding `NPM` and `Pagefind`.   Update: The result IS now available at https://tree.mcfate.family or the old site at https://helge.mcfate.family.

It should behave just like before with one BIG exception... the SEARCH bar near the top of the page.  

Last night I was doing some arm-chair research for my grandmother's 1926 travel journal and started wondering who the family would find when moving to Long Beach, CA.  I quickly lamented that my https://helge.mcfate.family site had no "search" feature of any kind... How was I going to find that Long Beach connection?  

Well, now that's a piece of cake.  Try it for yourself...
