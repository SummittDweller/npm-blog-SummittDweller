It's long overdue but this evening I managed to re-spin my `the-Helge-Project` genealogy website by adding `NPM` and `Pagefind`.   The result doesn't occupy the old https://helge.mcfate.family address YET, but it will soon enough.  For now you can find it at [https://mango-desert-0e7e19f0f.6.azurestaticapps.net/](https://mango-desert-0e7e19f0f.6.azurestaticapps.net/).

It should behave just like before with one BIG exception... the SEARCH bar near the top of the page.

Last night I was doing some arm-chair research for my grandmother's 1926 travel journal and started wondering who the family would find when moving to Long Beach, CA.  I quickly lamented that my https://helge.mcfate.family site had no "search" feature of any kind... How was I going to find that Long Beach connection?

Well, now that's a piece of cake.  Try it for yourself.
