Yesterday I took a quick look at a notes-taking app called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).  Very promising, but I'm already invested in [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/) (to the tune of $20/year) and it too has been rapidly improving.  So, I joined the [Drafts Community](https://forums.getdrafts.com/) and started looking for some guidance.  Today I'm going to try implementing one or two things based on [Generate Static Site from Drafts Notes](https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/generate-static-site-from-drafts-notes/9013/2).  Wish me luck!
