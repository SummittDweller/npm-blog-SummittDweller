The stupidity has already begun. There are just a couple EV charging stations here in the ramps, specifically in ramp three, but that ramp is marked as full even though I can see two open plug-in spaces. Am I allowed to go park there? No, because the ramp is full. The University of Iowa never fails to disappoint, they are always this ??????? stupid.
