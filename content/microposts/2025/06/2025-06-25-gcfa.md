I got it!  Only got wet the last 400 - 500 feet. Water was about 10" deep along the entire "bike route".  Saw no snakes, but I'm sure some saw me.  Scared the hell out of a park worker, twice.  Sorry about that.  I should have asked for a ride on her ATV, but not after scaring her so badly.  She probably thought I was the legendary "Florida Man".    

It was hellish here, but I consider this a victory... pretty sure I ate more bugs than were able to eat me.
