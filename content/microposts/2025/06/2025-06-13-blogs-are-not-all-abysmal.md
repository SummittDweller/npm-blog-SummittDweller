I’ve built lots of blogs over the years (and they were all abysmal) and several workflows for posting to them from my phone.  I finally have a workflow that is NOT as abysmal as my blog!  It uses a wonderful app called “Drafts” that I can use to create and post a quick little “micropost” that automatically records the time and place I posted from.  I use them to track significant events and where I’ve been mostly.  My blog is really meant for me and my own memory, it’s where I also put things I don’t want to forget.  I think I’ll add one now (from my phone) to remind me of a great blog address (https://gcmagicwander.blogspot.com) with a note about Drafts, too.  Take care.
