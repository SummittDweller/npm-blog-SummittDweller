Just dropped Emily and Natilie (2 international Grinnell College students) off at DSM for their holiday travel home.  Ivan, our 2024-25 FIS student from Bulgaria, is with me for a geocaching lunch/holiday event at Pizza Ranch.  After this a little geocaching then I'll drop Ivan at DSM for his flight home and I'll head for home before it gets dark on this shortest day of the year.
