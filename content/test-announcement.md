This is `/content/test-announcement.md`, posted as a test/sample announcement!  

To make an **announcement** like this appear on the home page you need to change the path of the file named `/content/.announcement.md` to `/content/announcement.md` (remove the preceeding dot so the file is no longer "hidden"), or create a new Markdown file named `/content/announcement.md` and push it to GitHub and the `main` branch of this project.
