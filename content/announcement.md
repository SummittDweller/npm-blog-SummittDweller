Check out my new [TESTING page](https://blog.summittdweller.com/testing/) where I hope to continue testing new features.  Also, be sure to have a look at my new [HIKES **site**](https://hikes.summittdweller.com/) and especially some of the "highlighted" hikes that are listed in bold there.

_Note that HIKES used to be a "section" here, but there are a lot of them so I made a site just for them._
