Hello Mark,

Thank you for getting back to us and for your patience!

I understand your concern and here to help. Firstly, I want to confirm that it's supported and you should be able to configure it in the App Platform. I reviewed your repo at "SummittDweller/wieting-theatre" and found that you have not configured the OAuth base_url in the config.yml file at 
https://github.com/SummittDweller/wieting-theatre/tree/main/static/admin

For testing purpose, I have forked your repo and deployed in my test account. I referred to the following article to deploy this test app:
http://www.vxk.cz/tips/2017/05/18/netlify-cms/

I have successfully deployed and configured the OAuth service in the test account. Here is the app  and OAuth link:
https://wieting-theatre-uf7ko.ondigitalocean.app/admin/ 
 https://netlifycms-auth-prbel.ondigitalocean.app

Please note that I will completely delete the repo and test app from my test account after this ticket is resolved. Just for your reference, I'm keeping this app active for now. 

Step 1: From the external client list [1], I have deployed the Node.js OAuth external client from that repo [2] listed on that website [1]. While deploying it on App Platform please set the following env variable for deployment to succeed:
KEYS: ORIGIN
VALUES: .*.ondigitalocean.app

KEYS: NODE_ENV
VALUES: production

Step 2: Create OAuth app in GitHub settings and set the Authorisation callback URL for OAuth. Please follow the documentation mentioned in [3]. You have to set the Home URL as the APP URL from Step 1 and Callback_URL as APP_URL/callback.

Homepage URL: https://netlifycms-auth-prbel.ondigitalocean.app
Authorization callback URL: https://netlifycms-auth-prbel.ondigitalocean.app/callback

Step 3: Once you have deployed both the apps (main app and OAuth service) then you have to link it by updating the configuration file "config.yml" present at [4]. You have to update the base_url to APP_URL from Step 1. You have refer to my forked repo configuration file at [5].
